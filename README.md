Code Explanation
Login and Logout
The login functionality is implemented using the useState hook. When users enter their email and password and click the "Login" button, the handleLogin function is called. This function performs validation (replace with your own logic) and sets the isLoggedIn state to true if the credentials are correct. The user's email and password are stored in the browser's local storage using localStorage.setItem.

The logout functionality is implemented in the handleLogout function. It removes the email and password from local storage and sets isLoggedIn to false, logging the user out.

Dashboard
If the user is logged in (isLoggedIn is true), the dashboard is displayed. You can add your own dashboard content here.

Styling and Animations
The code includes CSS styles and animations to enhance the user interface. The App.css file contains the styles for the login and dashboard components. Animation styles are added to provide a fade-in effect for the login form elements and a pulse effect for the login button. Additionally, error handling is implemented with a shake animation for the form container when there is a login error.
